# About Project
The main aim of this joint project is to design and develop an ontology for concepts in Cloud Computing. This will not only aid our understanding of structuring and designing ontologies, but will
also help organize terms related to Cloud Computing. This would make it easy to integrate the Ontology so it becomes easier for search engines, LLM's, etc. to use it.

Scope
Objective
To develop an ontology that standardizes the description, classification, and management of cloud resources and services across different cloud providers. This ontology will facilitate automated resource provisioning, interoperability, and service discovery.
Scope Definition
The ontology will cover the following key areas:
Cloud Service Models


IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Virtual machines, storage, networking.
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Development frameworks, containers, databases.
SaaS (Software as a Service): Web applications, collaboration tools, cloud-hosted software.
Cloud Resource Types


Compute: Virtual machines, containers, serverless functions.
Storage: Object storage, block storage, file storage.
Networking: Virtual networks, load balancers, firewalls.
Databases: SQL, NoSQL, managed database services.
Service Metadata & Attributes


Performance Metrics: CPU, RAM, latency, throughput.
Cost Models: Pay-as-you-go, subscription-based, reserved instances.
Security & Compliance: Encryption, access control, regulatory compliance.
Availability & Reliability: Uptime SLAs, failover mechanisms, redundancy.
Ontology Use Cases


Interoperability: Standardized terms for seamless cloud provider integration.
Automated Resource Selection: AI-driven recommendations based on workload needs.
Service Composition: Facilitating multi-cloud and hybrid cloud architectures.
Expected Outcome
A structured ontology that enables cloud resource classification, automated service provisioning, and intelligent service discovery, making cloud computing more efficient and scalable.
