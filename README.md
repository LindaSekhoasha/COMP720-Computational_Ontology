# About Project
The main aim of this joint project is to design and develop an ontology for concepts in Cloud Computing. This will not only aid our understanding of structuring and designing ontologies, but will
also help organize terms related to Cloud Computing. This would make it easy to integrate the Ontology so it becomes easier for search engines, LLM's, etc. to use it.
